# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the booking data of AtliQ Hotels to gain insights into hotel performance, room occupancy rates, and other key metrics. The analysis is performed using Python with the help of pandas and other data manipulation libraries in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project include:
- Importing and exploring the data to understand its structure and contents.
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Performing various analyses to uncover patterns and insights.
- Visualizing the results to communicate findings effectively.

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets, each stored in a CSV file:
- `dim_date.csv`: Contains date-related information.
- `dim_hotels.csv`: Contains information about the hotels.
- `dim_rooms.csv`: Contains details about the rooms in the hotels.
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`: Contains aggregated booking data.
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Contains detailed booking records.

## Steps

### Data Import and Exploration
- Importing the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas).
- Reading the CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
- Exploring the data to understand its structure, types, and initial observations.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Handling missing values, if any.
- Ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.
- Merging datasets where necessary to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Calculating key metrics such as occupancy rates, booking trends, and revenue.
- Grouping data by different dimensions (e.g., hotel, date, room category) to perform aggregated analyses.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies in the booking data.

### Data Visualization
- Creating visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate findings.
- Using visualization libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for effective data presentation.

## Conclusion and Insights
- Summarizing the key findings from the analysis.
- Providing recommendations based on the insights gained from the data.

## Example Insights
- **Occupancy Rates**: Analysis of how room occupancy rates vary across different hotels and time periods.
- **Booking Trends**: Identification of peak booking periods and low occupancy phases.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Insights into revenue generated from bookings, broken down by hotel and room category.

This overview outlines the general structure and purpose of the AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project. The actual notebook will contain detailed code, data manipulation steps, analysis results, and visualizations to achieve these objectives.
